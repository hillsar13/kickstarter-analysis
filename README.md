# Kickstarter Challenge: A Look into Launch Dates, Goals, and Outcomes

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project was to understand how other campaigns faired compared to our client's in terms of their launch dates and funding goals. Below, a series of analyses were completed to provide answers to the inquiry. Limitations, challenges, and results are included.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide our client clarity on how launch dates and funding goals may impact future campaigns, as our client reports her compaign fell short to the initial fundraising goal.
## Analysis and Challenges
We completed analyses on campaign outcomes based on launch dates and fundraising goals.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our pivot table created to reflect outcomes based on launch date returned advisable points. Successful campaigns seemed to fair best when launch in the summer months (peak month of May), and experienced a lull in successful outcomes in the later part of the year (Lowest month for success was December).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our Analyses on outcomes based on goals returned advisable points. Campaigns experienced the most success when their fundarising goal was less than $1,000 (close to 80% success rate). This number steadily drops to a 20% successrate when campaigns sought fundraising goals between $25,000-$29,999. Campaigns had their largest fail rates when the fundarising goal was set from $25,000-$34,999. However, there was a considerable amount of success (upwards of 60%) when campaigns held fundarising goals between $35,000-$44,999. Campaigns above $45,000 have a considerable fail rate, with fewer than 20% successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge exhibited in both analyses was determining correct filters and parameters to reflect the correct outcomes above. After numerous attempts, accurate parameters were set to reflect the data. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

There are several take aways from the Outcomes based on Launch Date analyses. First, campaigns are most successful in the summer months, with May providing the most successful outcomes based on Launch Date. Second, campaigns are least successful in the winter months, with December providing the least amount of successful outcomes based on Launch Date. It is advisable to the client to launch in the summerm for a higher chance of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

There are several take aways from the outcomes based on goals. First, campaigns fewer than $1,000 are the most successful campaigns, followed shortly by campaigns in the $1,000-$4,999 range. Campaigns experienced a %100 failrate when requesting a goal between $45,000-$49,999, and also experienced high failrates when asking for $25,000-$34,999. Our client's $4,000 goal fell into a more success outcome bracket (73% successful), which may led to thinking other factors may have hindered it's success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data is limited by the parameters as requested by the client. We are solely looking at fundraising goals and launch dates. There are numerous of variables to consider outside of this scope which limits our tunnel vision (what types of campaigns were launched? What style were they? Who is the Target audience? Who is leading the marketing campaign?)

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

To provide a broader picture, we could create tables highlighting the number of backers with outcomes in mind, or where the campaigns were launched (country) with outcomes in mind. Further analyses completed for this module reflect additional graphs as well, seen below.

# Further Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Assignment 
The intent of this section was to perform analyses on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends. Specifically, briefly look at kickstarter trends and averages across countries, categories, and years.

The success of one's campaign is dependent on what month, what country, what goal, and what type of kickstarter you are seeking.
